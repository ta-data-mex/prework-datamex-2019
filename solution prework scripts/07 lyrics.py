#Step 1: First Paragraph
#Create a code to print the first paragraph and asign it to a variable. 

babyshark_1 = ""
count = 0
for i in babyshark:
    babyshark_1 += str(i)
    if i == "\n":
        count += 1
    if count == 4:
        break
print(babyshark_1)


#Step 2: Full song
#Create a code that prints the complete lyrics. 

result = ""
for i in range(len(babyshark)):
    result += babyshark[i]
print(result)

#Step 3: Check output
#Now i want you must create a string variable called result to store all the characters and check if it is equal to the lyrics. Remenber de hint section. 

print(result == babyshark)

#Step 4: Function
#Create a functions called babyshark() that generates the wanted output.

#Step 5: Files
#Baby shark lyrics can be read in the songs folder. Try to store the content of that file in a variable called text and check if it is equal to the babyshark variable and the output of your baby_shark_lyrics function.

#Step 6: Refactor
#Now I want you to refactor your baby_shark_lyrics function in order to be less than 400 characters. If your code is larger than 400 characters, you should change baby_shark_lyrics function in order to shorten it.

#Bonus

#Step 1. Create bottles_lyrics function

#Step 2. Open file

#Step 3: Check code
